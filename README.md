## The first CanSat built and launched only by Chilean high school students

SIMESAT CanSat V1 is a device with characteristics of a nanosatellite, which accommodates a series of components inside a cylinder with the shape and dimensions of a soda can. Our CanSat has at its heart a Raspberry Pi Zero-W microcomputer which will reach an altitude of 29.000 meters above sea level.

## Simple and lightweight design with 3D printing

Using Autodesk Fusion 360, we have designed a simple and strong frame that will protect systems from impact, dirt and moisture.
<br><br>
Instead of using a single body, our CanSat is made up of two bodies joined by wire.

After 5 hours of flight, the CanSat will be received on the ground with the help of a parachute.
The work does not end here. This is only the beginning of a great journey full of feats and great achievements.
